Comments: Please remember that your last line should look like x = {A}.  In other words, it must contain braces.  Also, please be sure to write your student identification number and period number on every page.  Normally, this would result in an automatic 0.  Since you are a new student, you are still in your grace period and I will give you credit.  If you can, please make it so that the clips on the pencils face out so that they are easier to see.
